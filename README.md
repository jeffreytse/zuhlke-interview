# Zuhlke Interview Practice

This practice is __a pair-programming using TDD (Test Driven Development)__, and
using your own laptop, please have your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)
ready with a new Project containing one implementation class (doesn't matter
what you call it for now) and one unit test class for it and verify that you
are able to run unit tests within this Project (this will save time on setup
during the actual call session).

As this is a timed exercise, please do not set your project up as a Maven
project as this makes running unit tests very slow and hence adversely
affects your overall score.

## Screenshot

As I'm a heavily terminal user in my daily programming with different projects
and programming languages, I prefer to take this practice under terminal. If
you want to know more about my environment, you can see my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/jeffreytse/dotfiles)
project, which is managed by [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

This is a simple project created by [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle),
which is a better alternative to Maven, Gradle is adaptable, fast automation for all.

```sh
gradle init
```

Give it a glance:
